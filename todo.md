- add a disclaimer at the end of the show
- add a better logging system
- add something to auto clean up the audio files
- auto create directories if they don't exist for things like temp
- turn down music volume
- make a website for people to preview the project
- add a setup script so people can easily get started
- monitor when new news comes in to make sure the show isn't making duplicate news episodes
- GUI
- ask the user if they want to play the news episode after it's done or save it or send it
- use a more reliable method to split the audio files into more manageable chunks because the current method is not reliable (line breaks rather than like a list)
- add metadata to the audio files like an image and a description and a title and a date and a time
- maybe use AI to name the audio files better/ more relevantly
- more music options
- delay between intro and news then also for between news and outro (sounds nicer)
- give the hosts stronger personalities
