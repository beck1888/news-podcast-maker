ideas of things to add

- more voices
- randomly choose a host
- give the hosts personalities (e.g. one is always angry, one is always happy, maybe a southern one lol)
- ad breaks (fake ads for now)
- maybe gen audio for each story segment one by one to avoid the audio cutting off because the script is too long
