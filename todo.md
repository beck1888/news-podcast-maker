Ideas for future improvements:

- Add ad breaks with sound effects and transitions ([Pixabay SFX](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/news-broadcast-logo-154234/))
- Add credits with proper attribution:
  - News intro SFX: Sound Effect by [Vlad Krotov](https://pixabay.com/users/moodmode-33139253/) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
  - News outro SFX: Sound Effect by [Vlad Krotov](https://pixabay.com/users/moodmode-33139253/) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
  - Background music options with appropriate attributions.
  
- Add a disclaimer at the end of the show.
- Improve logging system.
- Automatically clean up temporary audio files.
- Auto-create directories as needed.
- Lower music volume.
- Create a website for project preview.
- Provide a setup script for easy installation.
- Monitor new news to avoid duplicate episodes.
- GUI enhancements.
- Ask the user whether to play, save, or send the episode.
- Use reliable methods to split audio instead of using line breaks.
- Add metadata (image, description, title, date/time) to audio files.
- Use AI for better audio file naming. (based on headlines - DO THIS NEXT!)
- More music options.
- Add delays (intro/news/outro) for smoother transitions.
- Give hosts stronger personalities.
- use sequential chunks to start making audio files before the script is fully generated and also use multithreading to make each chunk in parallel so it's faster to generate the audio file.
